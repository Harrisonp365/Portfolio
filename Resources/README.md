# My Portfolio

## Goals for the project

I wanted to create a simple to use and minimalist portfolio website that has a clean layout and is not too busy. I want to clearly show my projects and have links to the github repos for each project so users are able to see what I have been coding recently. 

I want the theme to be fairly monochromatic with the possibility of a light and dark mode.

The portfolio must be responsive not only in size but also to ensure it works as intended on all browsers, eg; fonts, images and icons.

## Wireframes

I have included the wireframes as PDF files in the "Resource" within the code but will also provide links below.
